# FT857-Web-browser-CAT
A radio management (CAT) is usually done by a software installed on a target computer. This software is most of the time developped under a dedicated operating system (Windows, Unix, Android, ...). This video shows a FT-857 CAT from a web browser, therefore independant of the operating system.
The web server is an ESP32 TTGO MCU connected to the FT-857.
The application software is derived from previous Arduino and ESP32 software developments. See my web site for more details (https://f6czv.fr)
